<p>The goal of this journal is to highlight my process and challenges to construct a production ready, monorepo web/mobile platform, using React and React Native.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is also meant to be a learning exercise for integrating and configuring many related popular libraries. I will be highlighting the steps to configure my preferred tools throughout this tutorial. However feel free to swap out any piece of technology as it suits your needs. I will provide links to the articles I’ve found useful as we go through.</p>
<p>In a brief breakdown, let’s review what we will be using.</p>

<p><u class="faded-highlight">core of our project</u>
<br />React - for our web application
<br />React Native - for our iOS and Android mobile applications
<br />Webpack - the bundler of our choice 
<br />Metro - the bundler without a choice
<br />Babel and Typescript - for transpiling and type checking
<br />ESlint and Prettier - for linting and formatting
<br />Jest, Detox and Enzyme - for testing</p>

<p><u class="faded-highlight">client end choices</u>
<br />Redux via Redux Toolkit - for state management
<br />React Router - for navigating this mess
<br />Styled Components - for fancy shmancy components
<br />Material UI - for boring components
<br />Formik and Yup - for forms and their validation
<br />Mapbox - for map and location interactions
<br />I18n-js - for internationalization and dictionary locales</p>

<p><u class="faded-highlight">infrastructure choices</u>
<br />AWS Amplify - for authentication (swap with Auth provider of your choice)
<br />GraphQL - for our queries (swap with DB of your choice)
<br />Apollo - for caching query data (also to sync user input in lack of connectivity)
<br />Bitbucket - for source code management
<br />CircleCI - for continuous integration pipeline
<br />Docker and AWS - for deploymentMixpanel - for analytics
<br />Optimizely - for A/B testing
<br />Segment - for metrics integration</p>

<p>To keep things tidy we will be using a branching workflow with frequent commits. Maintaining and growing our test suite will be a priority. As in agile best practices, we will limit our work in progress to a single task, and adhere to a strict definition of done so we don’t need to backtrack.</p>
<p><u class="faded-highlight">Our “Definition of Done” checklist</u>
<br />prepare tests (unit/integration/e2e)
<br />prototype the featuredeploy for review
<br />write release notes
<br />refactor &amp; push to production</p>

<p>It’s already a nauseating list, we have some work to do.</p>
<p>So let’s get to it.‍</p>
